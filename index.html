          Python, along with many other programming langauges,<br>
          use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). An ‘object’ is a discrete item.<br>
          OOP allows for the creation of classes, which are the generic forms of objects. <br>
          For example, a ‘flight’ class is defines all the components which describe a flight,<br>
          as well as actions that a flight should be able to take, such as adding a passenger. Similarly, <br>
          a passenger class would represent the generic idea of passenger, defined by a name and associated with a flight, perhaps.
